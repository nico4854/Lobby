# Discord Bot
## Dynamic Name Change

This is a [Discord Bot](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2) using [Discord.js](https://github.com/hydrabolt/discord.js/). It will, as the name suggest, dynamically change Voice Channel's name based on the [presence](http://discordjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs_client.html), e.g. what the participants is playing. It can be targeted to channels with prefix.
